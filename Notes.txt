I have used Helpers in app folder to dynamic Navbar

Steps:
1. Helpers folder is created into app folder.
2. common.php file is created into Helpers folder.
3. "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/",
            "Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/",
            "Database\\Seeders\\": "database/seeders/"
        },
        "files": [
        "app/Helpers/common.php"
    ]
    },
4. composer dump-autoload command is executed.
